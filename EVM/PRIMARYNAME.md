# Primary Name Resolution in Nominal Protocol

## Overview

The primary name resolution feature enhances the Nominal Protocol by allowing bidirectional resolution between names and addresses. This implements an important capability mentioned in the litepaper:

> A name's legitimacy and authority score can be computed by the SDK to provide a trust measure for users before interacting with an address.

## Implementation Details

We've added the following functionality to the `NameRegistryV1.sol` contract:

1. **Storage Enhancement**:
   - Added `mapping(address => string) private primaryNames` to track which name an address considers primary
   
2. **View Function**:
   - Added `nameOf(address addr)` to efficiently resolve addresses to names
   
3. **User Control**:
   - Added `setPrimaryName(string calldata name)` to let users explicitly choose their primary name
   
4. **Automatic Management**:
   - Updated registration logic to set first registered name as primary automatically
   - Updated transfer logic to handle primary name changes during ownership transfers
   
5. **Event Tracking**:
   - Added `PrimaryNameSet` event to track changes to primary names

## Integration with Architecture

This enhancement fits perfectly within the existing architecture:

1. **Single-purpose contract**: The functionality maintains the minimalist approach, adding only the essential mapping and functions.

2. **Client SDK benefits**: This functionality provides the data needed for the SDK to compute authority scores and display user identities in wallet interfaces.

3. **No bridges required**: Primary names are maintained independently on each chain, consistent with the cross-chain philosophy.

4. **Security-first**: Implementation follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern and maintains all security properties of the original contract.

## Use Cases

1. **Wallet integration**: Wallets can now efficiently show a human-readable name when displaying an address.

2. **Trust signaling**: Combined with the authority score (computed by the SDK), users can quickly verify the legitimacy of an address.

3. **Messaging applications**: Decentralized messaging apps can resolve addresses to names for better UX.

4. **Verified profiles**: Services can display primary names as part of a verified profile system.

## Test Strategy

The implementation includes tests that verify:
- Primary name setting during registration
- Explicit primary name changes
- Primary name transfers during ownership changes
- Edge cases like transferring to addresses with/without existing primary names

## Next Steps

1. Update the SDK to leverage the primary name functionality
2. Enhance the Authority Score calculation to consider primary name usage
3. Create wallet UI guidelines for displaying primary names
